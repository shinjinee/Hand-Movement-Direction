# Hand-Movement-Direction

This project calculates and displays the direction of movement of a hand using OpenCV. The detection model from hand has been taken from the repository [handtracking](https://github.com/victordibia/handtracking)
by [victordibia](https://github.com/victordibia). The 2 files in this repository are as follows:

- Hand_fourDir.py: Displays direction of immediate movement of detected hand (left, right, up, down).
- Hand_LR.py: Displays position of detected hand in the frame as left or right of the centre with a percentage measurement (e.g. 46% left)

This project was originally made with the intent of making a hand movement based remote controller.
